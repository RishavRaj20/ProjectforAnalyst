   ### What Is Financial Modeling?

   Financial modeling is the process of creating a summary of a company's expenses and earnings in the form of a spreadsheet that can be used to calculate the 
   impact of a future event or decision

   A financial model has many uses for company executives. Financial analysts most often use it to analyze and anticipate how a company's stock performance 
   might be affected by future events or executive decisions.

   In an increasingly interconnected world where digital transactions have become the norm the battle against fraud has taken on new dimensions. The challenge 
   lies not only in identifying familiar fraud patterns but also in unearthing the intricate web of evolving deceptions that threaten industries such as 
   finance, e-commerce, and insurance. As fraudsters continually adapt their tactics, the need for advanced, dynamic solutions is more critical than ever.

   ### Understanding fraud patterns

   In the intricate dance between deceit and vigilance, the first step towards effective fraud detection lies in comprehending the dynamic landscape of 
   fraudulent activities. Fraud, a chameleon-like phenomenon, assumes various forms across industries, making it imperative for us to recognize the  
   multifaceted patterns it takes.

   The world of financial transactions, for instance, experiences a range of fraudulent behaviors, from seemingly innocuous anomalies to elaborate orchestrated 
   schemes. Payments originating from unfamiliar geolocations or transactions deviating significantly from user spending patterns are just a glimpse of the 
   subterfuge that occurs. Similarly, e-commerce platforms contend with fake accounts, account takeovers, and the ever-elusive “friendly fraud.”
